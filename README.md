# calcualteVelocityFromTwoCoordinates
A simple application written in java that takes in 2 coordiantes as input and returns the velocity (speed/time direction). This application uses Haversine formula to compute the distance. And calculates the direction using the greater than or lower than operators of latitiude a and latitude b as well as longitude a and longitude b.


## Further devlopment
If I was to continue devleoping this maybe I would add and interface of a map where users can choose two points instead and or type in a city or address. Maybe even add where they can choose there vehicle of choice. But an even cooler idea would be to let users not only travel from point a to poin tb on earth but what about space or another planet. That would present its own challenge since other Planets isnt fully maped and space doent have a north or south and have 3d coordiantes so the math would be a lot different since radius wouldnt be considered and now we would have to work with 3D cordinates. So good luck with that.
